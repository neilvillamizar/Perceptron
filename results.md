### Results:

#### Using perceptron with learning rate of 0.001:
total number of tests: 60000
number of successful classifications: 7274
number of wrong classifications: 2726
The percentage of successful classifications is: 72.74

#### Using perceptron with learning rate of 0.01:
total number of tests: 60000
number of successful classifications: 7407
number of wrong classifications: 2593
The percentage of successful classifications is: 74.07

#### Using perceptron with learning rate of 0.1:
total number of tests: 60000
number of successful classifications: 7098
number of wrong classifications: 2902
The percentage of successful classifications is: 70.98

As we can see, the percentage of sucessfuls classifications are on average
 72%. this shows that the perceptron are a great tool when it comes to classifying
 but when the data set does not meet linear separability this structure 
 does not get the optimal result (100%).
